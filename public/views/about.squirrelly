		Hello! My name is Sara Weatherman and I am a pet portrait artist and digital Illustrator based in Wichita Kansas. Shape and color are my passions and I enjoy creating work that tells the unique story of your furry, scaly, or feathery friends. I love working and collaborating with others on making ideas come to life and seeing how far that first sketch can go. I really like birbs, send me birbs i drool on birbs
